# React_ExpressJS_App
This web app is created using React as the frontend and NodeJS, Express JS as the backend  

This app has a login page where the client can login or sign up if they don't have an account.   

The Routes are done using React Routes to fulfill a single page application and the data is fetched using Express JS.  

When the user is logged in, they are greeted with a welcome alongside their full name and they can see a list of their friends. I have not added the feature to add friends yet, but will do so in the future.  

The user can also search existing users or people they know. The search feature can't access other people's profile yet, but will be added in the future.  

Note: This project is focused on getting the functionality done first so you will see minimal styling or CSS.
